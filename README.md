论文《基于教师-纠错模型的目标检测数据集自动扩充方法研究》相关实验代码及数据集公开。数据集标注使用VOC标准，由于数据集较大，故使用百度网盘公开。
警告：代码尚未整理，可读性很差

论文录用后会抽时间整理的


如果需要实验原始数据及记录也可与我联系（这玩意真会有人要吗？）


The experimental code and dataset related to the paper "Auto-Augmenting Object Detection Datasets via Teacher-Corrector Dual Modeling" are now publicly available.The dataset annotation uses the VOC standard. Due to the large size of the dataset, Baidu Netdisk is used for sharing.

Warning: The code has not been organized yet and its readability is very poor. 
I will take time to tidy it up after the paper is accepted.

If you need the original experimental data and records, feel free to contact me (Would anyone really want this stuff?).
